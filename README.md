# LogicCircuit
> Code by JohnyStudent :white_check_mark:
### // Objective: Some arduino codes that can help you with some problems
### // Recommendation: Use Logisim to study more about logic circuits;
## // Please do it:
  - Read all comments (introduction and explanation);
  - If possible, mention the repository link in your work as a reference;

## // Files menu:
  1. Equivalence**XXX**gate: To demonstrate the equivalence of logic gate XXX based on the NAND and NOR ports. Composed of a Logisim file and an image of it.

-> Equivalence*NOT*gate;
-> Equivalence*AND*gate;
-> Equivalence*OR*gate;
-> Equivalence*XOR*gate;
-> Equivalence*XNOR*gate;
  
  2. **HalfAdder**: Logic circuit of a half adder, to calculate the sum of 2 bits. Composed of a Logisim file and an image of it.
  
  3. **FullAdder**: Logic circuit of a full adder, to calculate the sum of 2 bits. Composed of a Logisim file and an image of it.
